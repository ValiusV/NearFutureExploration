## Features

A set of parts to help enhance and improve the KSP probe experience, particularly in the later game with larger probes

* **More Probe Cores:**  A set of eight new probe cores in medium (1.25m) and larger (1.875m) sizes. 
* **Probe Bus Parts:**  Cargo bay-like parts that match the footprints of most probe cores (stock and NFX). Useful for storing batteries, fuel and the like
* **Probe Fuel Tanks:**  New multi-fuel probe tanks in stack and radial sizes that are in the vein of the stock Dumpling and Baguette
* **More Direct and Relay Antennae:**  More antennae that seamlessly fit into the KSP CommNet system to fill in missing ranges and add more interesting options.
* **Reflector Antennae:**  A new type of antenna that does nothing on its own, but instead bounces signal from another antenna to amplify its range. Point antenna at a deployed reflector to recieve the bonus. Available in many sizes. 
* **Small Probe Parts:**  A few small probe parts (battery, reaction wheel) to fill out the probe range

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [ModuleManager (4.2.3)](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
* [B9PartSwitch (2.20.0)](https://github.com/blowfishpro/B9PartSwitch)

### Optional
These components are optional but can add to the play experience

* [ReStock](https://github.com/PorktoberRevolution/ReStocked/): Redoes most of KSP's art to be consistent. This pack targets ReStock's art style.
* [ReStock+](https://github.com/PorktoberRevolution/ReStocked/): Adds more useful parts, like mini RCS thrusters.
* [Community Resouce Pack](https://github.com/BobPalmer/CommunityResourcePack): Allows probe tanks to contain more resources
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/post-kerbin-mining-corporation/CommunityTechTree): Places highest-tech antennae and probes in higher tech nodes

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* [KSP-AVC](https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker): Provides version checking
* [Community Tech Tree](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CommunityTechTree): Provides an expanded, community-sourced technology tree for modders to use

Note that the vast majority of this compatibility is community-sourced and not maintained by me.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
